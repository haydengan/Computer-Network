## Lab 2 & Lab 3
These two repos contain code for UDP communication using the RFC 865 - Quote of the Day protocol and Lab3 report. They show how the Internet really works and how the concept of encapsulation is being implemented in the different layers of the TCP/IP protocol suite. 

## Lab 4
Lab4 repo contains analysis code to sniff and analyze network packets, including packes capturing, data encapsulation, observation of data link PDU, network PDU, transport PDU and application PDU
